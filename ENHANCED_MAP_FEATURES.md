### 3. Pan and Navigation
- **Drag to Pan**: Click and drag to move around the map
- **Smooth Movement**: Fluid panning with visual feedback
- **Boundary Constraints**: Prevents panning beyond map boundaries

### 4. Real Railway Data Integration
- **Authentic Stations**: Real railway stations with correct names and codes
- **Accurate Routes**: Actual railway lines with proper electrification status
- **Geographic Accuracy**: Stations positioned based on real coordinates
- **Network Statistics**: Live statistics about the railway network

### 5. Enhanced Visual Features
- **Professional Track Patterns**: Different visual styles for:
